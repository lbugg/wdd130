    <h2>Logan</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone, I'm Logan. I'm 26 and currently living alone in Wyoming, and I'm working towards an Applied Technology degree. My 
    hope is to end up doing programming, since I took some courses on that in high school and enjoyed them, but I figure web design
    is a handy skill regardless of what I end up doing. Due to health issues I work from home, and hope to be able to continue with 
    that in the future. For fun I mostly read or play video games, though I do enjoy playing tabletop roleplaying games like Pathfinder 
    with my friends when I can.
    </p>
