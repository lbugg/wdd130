            <h2 id="section-title">Hybrid Study</h2>
            <p>For his hybrid study Robin chooses the Sparkling Targe, so he wields a shield in addition to his sword. This also 
            gives him the Shielding Strike focus spell, which he uses to both raise his shield and recharge his Spellstrike. 
            Lastly, it causes his Arcane Cascade stance to grant his shield bonus to his saves, increase the hardness of his 
            shield so it can block more damage, and allow him to use it to block damage from spells.</p>

            <h2 id="section-title">Class Feats</h2>
            <p>With Robin’s class feats, he focuses on those that will allow him to identify enemy abilities and weaknesses, so he 
            can always capitalize on them with Spellstrike and Arcane Cascade. After that, he takes those that improve his 
            capabilities with a shield so he can be a better frontliner. Lastly, he grabs Attack of Opportunity to help him 
            dissuade enemies from trying to get past him, so he can protect his more vulnerable allies.</p>
            <h2 id="section-title">General Feats</h2>
            <p>Robin’s general feats are spent improving his base stats, so he is more likely to survive being in front. Armor 
            Proficiency lets him wear heavy armor, Toughness increases his health, and Fleet gives him some needed mobility to get 
            into the fight more quickly.</p>
            <h2 id="section-title">Archetype Feats</h2>
            <p>With his free archetype feats, Robin chooses Witch for a familiar and some spells from the divine list. This gives 
            him more flexibility when it comes to Spellstrike and Arcane Cascade damage types, as well as some nice utility 
            spells. After taking those feats, he branches into Wizard to add some extra arcane spells to the ones he can already 
            cast from being a magus.</p>
