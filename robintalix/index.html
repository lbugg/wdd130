            <p id="text1">Robin is a half-elf, with a human father and an elven mother, though he was adopted as a baby by the owner of the 
            local bookstore and was raised by him and his husband. He helps to run the bookstore, but with his capabilities he is 
            often called on to help elsewhere with more esoteric problems.</p>

            </div>
            <p id="text2">Robin is also a magus, the hybrid martial class that uses both weapons and spells. The magus is an 
            intelligence-based prepared arcane caster, meaning it uses intelligence to calculate its spell attacks and DCs, and it 
            stores spells from the arcane list in a spellbook, choosing each day which ones to prepare in its available slots. The 
            magus also possesses the unique ability to deliver a spell attack through a weapon attack, using the Spellstrike class 
            feature. Lastly, it can use its Arcane Cascade ability to enter a stance where its weapon is empowered based on its 
            most recent spell cast.</p>
