      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My friends and I play a lot of Pathfinder 2nd Edition together. I have a lot more experience with the system than they do,
           and I’d like to make a website that will explain how my character works, how he was made, and how he plays. Have you 
           ever felt dumb because you were introduced to a new game or program that everyone else knew but you didn’t? I want to 
           make this website so that my friends, and others who are new to the system, can easily learn how things work to help 
           them with their own characters without feeling dumb because of all the questions they have.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My friends, as well as others who want to learn and better understand the system, should be able to read through the 
          information I post about my character to help them build and play their own.  The hope is that through explaining the 
          choices I made with the build, and the mechanics behind how he actually functions, they can get a better handle on how 
          the game works and how characters builds are meant to flow.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
