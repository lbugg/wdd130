      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My friends and I play a lot of Pathfinder 2nd Edition together. I have a lot more experience with the system than they do,
           and I’d like to make a website that will explain how my character works, how he was made, and how he plays. Have you 
           ever felt dumb because you were introduced to a new game or program that everyone else knew but you didn’t? I want to 
           make this website so that my friends, and others who are new to the system, can easily learn how things work to help 
           them with their own characters without feeling dumb because of all the questions they have.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My friends, as well as others who want to learn and better understand the system, should be able to read through the 
          information I post about my character to help them build and play their own.  The hope is that through explaining the 
          choices I made with the build, and the mechanics behind how he actually functions, they can get a better handle on how 
          the game works and how characters builds are meant to flow.

      <h3>The Man</h3>
      <p>
        Robin is a half-elf, with a human father and an elven mother, though he was adopted as a baby by the owner of the local bookstore and was raised by him and his husband. He helps to run the bookstore, but with his capabilities he is often called on to help elsewhere with more esoteric problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robin is also a magus, the hybrid martial class that uses both weapons and spells. The magus is an intelligence-based prepared arcane caster, meaning it uses intelligence to calculate its spell attacks and DCs, and it stores spells from the arcane list in a spellbook, choosing each day which ones to prepare in its available slots. The magus also possesses the unique ability to deliver a spell attack through a weapon attack, using the Spellstrike class feature. Lastly, it can use its arcane cascade ability to enter a stance where its weapon is empowered based on its most recent spell cast.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Build</h3>
      <p>
        For his hybrid study Robin chooses the Sparkling Targe, so he wields a shield in addition to his sword. This also gives him the Shielding Strike focus spell, which he uses to both raise his shield and recharge his Spellstrike. Lastly, it causes his Arcane Cascade stance to grant his shield bonus to his saves, increase the hardness of his shield so it can block more damage, and allow him to use it to block damage from spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Robin’s class feats, he focuses on those that will allow him to identify enemy abilities and weaknesses, so he can always capitalize on them with Spellstrike and Arcane Cascade. After that, he takes those that improve his capabilities with a shield so he can be a better frontliner. Lastly, he grabs Attack of Opportunity to help him dissuade enemies from trying to get past him, so he can protect his more vulnerable allies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his free archetype feats, Robin chooses Witch for a familiar and some spells from the divine list. This gives him more flexibility when it comes to Spellstrike and Arcane Cascade damage types, as well as some nice utility spells. After taking those feats, he branches into Wizard to add some extra arcane spells to the ones he can already cast from being a magus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robin’s general feats are spent improving his base stats, so he is more likely to survive being in front. Armor Proficiency lets him wear heavy armor, Toughness increases his health, and Fleet gives him some needed mobility to get into the fight more quickly.

      <h3>The Playstyle</h3>
      <p>
        When playing a magus, the main goal is to Spellstrike as often as you can, capitalizing on enemy weaknesses whenever possible. Ideally, you should be able to look at a fight and know in advance whether entering Arcane Cascade will be necessary, and if you’ll need to recharge Spellstrike multiple times. Generally, if you think the fight will last more than three or four rounds, or if there are enemies with a weakness you can exploit, enter Arcane Cascade. Otherwise, it’s probably not worth the action.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I play Robin, I often start the fight by spending one action to Recall Knowledge, hoping to identify enemy vulnerabilities or abilities I should be concerned about. After that, I either move into range and attack, or cast a spell. In the lucky chance that I’m already in range, that spell can be a Spellstrike. On the next turn, I enter Arcane Cascade and then either move and use Shielding Strike or attempt a Magus’s Analysis and then either strike or raise his shield.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that point on it becomes a balancing act of recharging Spellstrike (either through Magus’s Analysis, Shielding Strike, or just spending an action) and Spellstriking as often as possible. I try to aim for Spellstriking once every two rounds, or three rounds if I need to use his shield more actively. With Produce Flame, Ray of Frost, Gouging Claw, Electric Arc, Disrupt Undead, and Divine Lance, he can strike just about any weakness and add almost every damage type to his Arcane Cascade.
